                        <h2>What I Worked On</h2>
                        <p>
                            I started Hill Country Pressure Wash after noticing that many homeowners needed help maintaining fences, decks, and outdoor spaces, but did not have the time or equipment to do it properly. I focused on residential jobs and offered whatever exterior cleaning would make the biggest difference for the property.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            The work was hands-on from start to finish. Jobs typically involved pressure washing fences, porches, and concrete, letting everything dry for several days, sanding wood surfaces, and returning to stain using oil-based products.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            I handled everything myself, including branding, logos, scheduling, customer communication, equipment purchases and repairs, and the labor itself. I never spent money on advertising, and all of my clients came through referrals and word of mouth.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            There was a learning curve, and I made mistakes. One time I stained a deck without sanding it properly, so I redid the entire job for free until it was right. That experience shaped how I approach work now: take responsibility, fix problems fully, and leave people happy with the result.
                            </p>
